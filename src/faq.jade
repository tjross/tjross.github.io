                          li The first step of the process is filling out your design brief. As soon as you know what you want to make, click Get Started and start filling out our design brief where you will answer a series of questions describing your product and add any pictures or sketches you think that will help articulate what you are trying to make. When you finish, click “submit” and we will connect you with a world-class industrial designer who will help bring your product to life. 
                          li Once you are assigned to a designer, you will talk about the product you want to make, asking any questions you might have and communicating anything else you need to say about the product to make sure you and your designer are on the same page.
                          li In the next stage of the process, your designer will provide a digital rendering or preview of your product. This will look very similar to the final product so this is your chance to tell the designer what you like and what you would like to change. You and your designer will then iterate on the design until you are in love with your design.
                          li Finally, once you are happy with the design, you choose the material you want it made in and finalize the order. You will then be charged, the item will be sent to manufacturing and then shipped to you.

It is our goal to enable the design and manufacturing of products specifically for YOU, so whether you majored in Industrial Design or have never touched any design software in your life, our goal is to make design and manufacturing easy and accessible so you can bring your ideas and the meaning behind them to life.

                        | At 43Layers, all of our products are made using digital fabrication technology. This means all of our products are designed with computer aided design software and then manufactured with software powered manufacturing tools (for now primarily 3D printing and laser cutting). Just like an MP3 is a digital version of a song, we create designs that are digital versions of a physical product. We then use 3D printing and laser cutting and turn those designs into physical objects. These products are infinitely easier to customize than with traditional manufacturing because the product design itself is digital so any customization we need to do can be done with software and it will be manufactured precisely to spec.

                        | 3D Printing takes digital files and turns them into physical products. It is often referred to as additive manufacturing, as the product is built up layer by layer in the material of your choosing. 3D Printing refers to several different processes that are applied based on the specific material type, including the most popular, selective laser sintering.

                          | Laser cutting is a precise method of cutting a design from a given material using a computer aided design (CAD) file to guide it. Laser cutting uses a computer to direct the output high-power laser at a given material to be cut. The material then melts, burns or vaporizes leaving an edge with a high-quality finish.

                        | Refunds for credit card, PayPal or bank transfer payments are issued in the original form of payment and will reflect the amount paid. It may take 3-7 business days for the refund to appear in your account. Orders paid with store credit, gift cards, or promotional dollars will be returned in that form.
                        | We may contact you to obtain additional information if necessary. In certain cases where we determine a refund is not appropriate, we may issue store credit.
