            <h1 class="text-center">43Layers Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>The following are terms and conditions of a legal agreement between you and 43Layers, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “43Layers”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These terms and conditions govern your use of the services we offer (“43Layers Services” or “Services”) and the use of www.43layers.com (the “43Layers Website” or “Website”).</p>
            <p>By using the 43Layers Website, you acknowledge to have read, understood and agree to be bound by these “Terms and Conditions” and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, you should not use the 43Layers Services and Website.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">43 Layers Services</h2>
            <p>The 43Layers Services are made up of different services provided through the Website. One of our Services enables you to create a design project where you are connected with a designer to help you bring a consumer product idea to life as a 3D model.</p>
            <p>If you want to turn your 3D model into a physical product, you can place an order with us to have it manufactured. At a charge of a service price and price for the substance used for the product, we manufacture the product for you (i.e., print it with 3D printing or laser cutting technology) in our materials and ship it to you. You can also order products designed by other 43Layers members: 43Layers allows you to browse the Website for products in our Gallery (“Recent Customer Creations” section), to view these products and to place an order for the manufacturing of an available product.</p>
            <p>Further, 43Layers offers other services and community features through the Website including a forum, a blog, tutorials etc. where you can get in touch with other users or share your experiences.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Account Terms</h2>
            <p>You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to use this Service. If you are under 18, you may use 43Layers.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. You must provide current, accurate identification, contact, and other information that may be required as part of the registration process and/or continued use of the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Service password and account, and are responsible for all activities that occur there under. We will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your account and password. We reserve the right to refuse service to or terminate service of anyone at any time without notice for any reason.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Ordering</h2>
            <p>1) Placing an order To confirm order the product you click the Accept Design button. Then you can select the quantity of the product you order and the material you want the product to be made of. As the next step, we ask you to provide us with information we need for the delivery of the product. Finally you will be redirected to our payment provider’s website to initiate your payment. Please be informed that the language to be used during the whole ordering process is English.</p>
            <p>2) Unacceptable orders, cancellation of orders by us If a product is available through our Website (in the “Recent Customer Creations” or “Design Center” section), the basic assumption is that it can be produced. There are however technical or other reasons why 43Layers may not accept or cancel your order during the entire ordering process, even after our acceptance of your order. Such reasons can be for example but not limited to the unfeasibility of the 3D model, the infringing feature of your product, the destination of the delivery you indicated in your order etc. In case we cancel your partial or entire order we will contact you via email and at 43Layers discretion will issue you store credit or a full refund for the cancelled item(s).</p>
            <p>3) Prices for a Product The prices displayed for a given product are only indications and are valid only for the moment that they are displayed. 43Layers reserves the right to change its prices without prior notice. Such change however will have no effect on orders completed before the posting of a new price on the Gallery. We do our best to prevent errors in the pricing. However, should an error occur, we are not bound by our offer and may cancel the order. Any monies paid related to that order will be refunded to you.</p>
            <p>4) Payment and price The amount indicated on the ordering page includes the fee for the Service (such as printing and packing the product) and the price for the materials used to produce the product. The price quoted on the Website includes shipping costs, sales tax (if applicable) but excludes any import duty or taxes (if applicable). All prices are indicated in either U.S. dollars (USD) or Euro (EUR). If you do not pay in USD or EUR, the currency conversion will be handled by our payment service provider.</p>
            <p>You can also initiate your payment for your order via PayPal.com. If you chose to pay using PayPal you will be directed to the PayPal.com website. </p>
            <p>43Layers shall not be responsible in any way for the payment process done via the PayPal.com website. Please familiarize yourself with the terms of use of those services of PayPal.</p>
            <p>We will not perform the Services until we received confirmation either via PayPal that the transfer of the amount indicated in the order confirmation form has been completed or the funds arrive on our bank account.</p>
            <p>5) Acceptance After accepting your order we will send you an order confirmation by e-mail address associated with your 43Layers account. The order confirmation will be effective as of the date on which the order confirmation is sent to you. If we cannot accept your order we will contact you by email. You should verify the details in the confirmation email. If there are errors you should contact us as soon as possible by sending an email to customer service at contact@43layers.com.</p>
            <p>6) Order Tracking Through the Website or – if you choose so – via e-mail notifications, you can track the status of your order e.g. accepted order, produced, dispatched, delivered etc. However we continuously change and improve this system.</p>
            <p>7) Shipping Your order will be delivered to your shipping address. We deliver to multiple countries. You can only select those countries as your shipping address during the ordering process. We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ship the product to the shipping address within the delivery time indicated in our confirmation email nevertheless depending on your shipping address it may take longer time. Any shipping and delivery dates given by us are only best estimates and we are not liable for any damage or cost caused by delay in shipping or delivery. Title and risk of loss is transferred to you upon transfer of the goods from 43Layers to the shipment carrier (FOB Shipping Point, EX Works).</p>
            <p>8) Cancellation of your order, return of products. Due to the personalized feature of our Services (i.e. the product is supplied by us based on your specifications), you can not cancel your order after it goes into production. Orders that contain non-refundable items are still cancelable, however note that refund or cancellation will not apply to items in the order that are non-refundable.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Warranty</h2>
            <p>43Layers warrants only that the product manufactured by us will substantially meet the features of the indicated 3D model within the limitations of the 3D printing or laser cutting technology. 43Layers does not give any warranty about the products and does not guarantee that the product will be fit for any particular purposes.
