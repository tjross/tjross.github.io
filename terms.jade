At a charge of a service price and price for the substance used for the product, we manufacture the product for you (i.e., print it with 3D printing or laser cutting technology) in our materials and ship it to you. You can also order products designed by other 43Layers members: 43Layers allows you to browse the Website for products in our Gallery (“Recent Customer Creations” section), to view these products and to place an order for the manufacturing of an available product.
